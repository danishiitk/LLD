Sure, here's a list of all the classes along with their methods:
Sure, here are all the classes suggested in the design:
1. Piece
2. Board
3. Player
4. Game

Each of these classes plays a specific role in modeling and implementing the chess game.
Sure, in addition to the classes, there are also enums used in the design:
1. PieceType
2. Color

These enums represent different types of chess pieces and colors of the pieces, respectively. They are used
within the Piece class to define the type and color of each piece.

1. **Piece**
   - `Piece(PieceType type, Color color)`
   - `getType(): PieceType`
   - `getColor(): Color`

2. **Board**
   - `Board()`
   - `initializeBoard()`
   - `movePiece(int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY): boolean`
   - `isCheck(Color color): boolean`
   - `isCheckmate(Color color): boolean`

3. **Player**
   - `Player(Color color, boolean isTurn)`
   - `makeMove(Board board, int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY): boolean`
   - `getColor(): Color`
   - `isTurn(): boolean`

4. **Game**
   - `Game()`
   - `startGame()`
   - `endGame()`
   - `isGameOver(): boolean`
   - `getCurrentPlayer(): Player`
   - `displayBoard()`

Remember, some of these methods might be private or could involve additional methods or logic within them.
This list provides a high-level overview of the classes and their functionalities.
