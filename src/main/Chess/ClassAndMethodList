Sure, here's a list of all the classes along with their methods:
Sure, here are all the classes suggested in the design:
1. chess_pieces.Piece
2. Board
3. Player
4. Game

Each of these classes plays a specific role in modeling and implementing the chess game.
Sure, in addition to the classes, there are also enums used in the design:
1. chess_pieces.PieceType
2. Color

These enums represent different types of chess chess_pieces and colors of the chess_pieces, respectively. They are used
within the chess_pieces.Piece class to define the type and color of each piece.

1. **chess_pieces.Piece**
   - `chess_pieces.Piece(chess_pieces.PieceType type, Color color)`
   - `getType(): chess_pieces.PieceType`
   - `getColor(): Color`

2. **Board**
   - `Board()`
   - `initializeBoard()`
   - `movePiece(int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY): boolean`
   - `isCheck(Color color): boolean`
   - `isCheckmate(Color color): boolean`

3. **Player**
   - `Player(Color color, boolean isTurn)`
   - `makeMove(Board board, int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY): boolean`
   - `getColor(): Color`
   - `isTurn(): boolean`

4. **Game**
   - `Game()`
   - `startGame()`
   - `endGame()`
   - `isGameOver(): boolean`
   - `getCurrentPlayer(): Player`
   - `displayBoard()`

Remember, some of these methods might be private or could involve additional methods or logic within them.
This list provides a high-level overview of the classes and their functionalities.
