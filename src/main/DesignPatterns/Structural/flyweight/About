Character is the Flyweight interface defining the method draw() for drawing characters.
ConcreteCharacter is the concrete flyweight class implementing the Character interface.
CharacterFactory is the flyweight factory responsible for managing and creating flyweight objects.
TextEditor is the client code that uses the flyweight objects to draw characters.
The CharacterFactory ensures that only one instance of each character is created and reused when needed.
This way, memory usage is minimized, especially when dealing with a large amount of text.
